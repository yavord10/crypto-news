                        The records that the network accepted are added to a block. Each block contains 
                        a unique code called a hash. It also contains the hash of the previous block in the 
                        chain.</p>

                        cryptocurrency space's rough equivalent to an IPO in the mainstream investment 
                        world. ICOs act as fundraisers of sorts; a company looking to create a new coin, 
                        app, or service launches an ICO.</p>
                    <p> In an ICO, a quantity of cryptocurrency is sold in the form of "tokens" ("coins") to 
                        speculators or investors, in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies such 
                        as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The tokens sold are promoted as future functional units of 
                        currency if or when the ICO's funding goal is met and the project launches. 
                        In some cases like Ethereum the tokens are required to use the system for its purposes.</p>
                    <p>An ICO can be a source of capital for startup companies. ICOs can allow startups to avoid regulatory 
                        compliance and intermediaries such as venture capitalists, banks and stock exchanges.</p>

                    IEO works on different cryptocurrency exchanges depending on how it gets planned. 
                    The exchanges create a platform where the pool of developers can mint and sell the projects 
                    to crypto enthusiasts and investors!</p>
                    <p>Before the token sale gets conducted on the IEO exchange platform, both the exchange team 
                        and the project team will deal with an agreement. The exchange platform will do a thorough 
                        review of the project using certain conditions to make sure the project is worthy authentic.</p>
                    <p>Once the exchange platform is comfortable with the project, it will unveil the date for token sale 
                        along with the fixed price per token. If in case the exchange has its own token, then the contributors 
                        have to purchase the units of tokens before they can participate in Initial Exchange Offering.</p>

                        the authenticity of information and updating the blockchain with the transaction. The mining process 
                        itself involves competing with other cryptominers to solve complicated mathematical problems with 
                        cryptographic hash functions that are associated with a block containing the transaction data.</p>
                    <p>The first cryptocurrency miner to crack the code is rewarded by being able to authorize the transaction, 
                        and in return for the service provided, cryptominers earn small amounts of cryptocurrency of their own. 
                        In order to be competitive with other cryptominers, though, a cryptocurrency miner needs a computer with 
                        specialized hardware.</p>
